## Summary
[Brew](https://brew.sh) is the package manager that has been missing from OSX. (A package manager is a system used to install, update, and remove programs aka packages)

## Basics
### Install a Package
```brew install <package>```
I like to just try the package I am looking for to see if its there. You can always search for it on the site if that is more your style.

Some bigger programs are casks. Things like Firefox fall under this category. Installing them is as easy as adding --cask to the install command
```brew install --cask firefox```

### Uninstall 
```brew uninstall <package>```
This is pretty obivious

### Update
```brew update```
Brew will do its best to update first no matter what command you are using but in case you specifically want to update run this.
