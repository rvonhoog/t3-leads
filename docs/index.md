# How to Lead (T3)
###### A guide according to Richard
## Basic Day Rundown
### Email
This is interupt based for me. What this means is when I get a new notification I stop and check it. It is the first thing I check when I come in though.

### Chats
This one is also interupt based but I make an effort to check more often then I would if I was just checking notifications. Biggest tip on this is to pin all the T3 channels and your direct report. 

### Activities
For activities I check whenever I think of it. This is usually after I have just done something else. Ex: Finish a chat, time to check for new activities. This right now is the top pirority and trumps anything else. That is of course subject to change. 

### QA
There will be a quota of calls you should listen to, correct if needed, and review. Currently it sits at 5 for the week. I would suggest spreading that out to one a day but if doing them all on one day works better then do that. 

Here is a link to the form for the review:

### Special Requests
Lastely we have special requests, which come in two flavors: Special Projects and Ad-Hoc. 

Special Projects are what we work on during times when everything else is in a solid state. Great canidates for these are anything that will make the team better and faster or help you be better and faster. 

Ad-Hoc are things that come up during the day. More often then not these should, if not already coming from, be cleared by your direct report. Be helpful but not afriad to say no, table a request, or push it to your direct report to piroritize. 

## General Tips
I found time blocking to be very helpful. The idea here is to schedule out your day and do not do anything but the scheduled activity during that time. Once you pick the time block commit to it by blocking in out in your calender. Ex: first 15 mins blocked of everyday blocked to check emails and other messages. 

There is a concept called 'eat the frog'. The basics of it is to take the most hairy, ugly, and least favorite activity that you have to do and doing it first. The reasoning being 1. you have most energy first thing and 2. once you get that out of the way rest of your day becomes easier. 

Do not be afraid to personalize a workflow, expressly anything in this guide. Find ways that work for you. Also I would advised against settling. Try to find ways to improve your systems. 

Share your knowledge. Reason you are in the position you are in is becuase you know your stuff. Don't horde it as your personal dragon treasure. Make it go viral. When you find a way of doing something that works much better for you let others know cause you never know if someone else is experiencing that same thing. 

Don't be afriad to seek out others. Asking people to get a second, third, or however many number opinon is not a sign of weakness. There is something to be said about being confindient in what you know but also it never hurts to hear another voice and/or to sync up to make sure you and your comerades have the same voice. 

Something I wish I would have started from the start was keeping track of every question asked to and from me with the answer. This could easily become a go to reference. If you include who asked and had the answer could identify recurring issue. Example: 

Date | Who Asked | Question | Who Answered | Answer
